## Project Vision
**Blind Hunt VR** is a VR hide-and-seek game that places players in the perspective of someone with blindness. The game focuses on sensory deprivation, where players must rely on **echolocation** to navigate and interact with the world. Through sound pulses, players can visualize their surroundings for brief moments, simulating how sound bounces off objects in real life.

### Key Features:
- **Echolocation-based navigation**: Players use sound pulses to create temporary visual representations of their environment.
- **Environmental interaction**: Objects in the environment react to sound, providing both obstacles and opportunities.


### Future Updates:
- **Multiplayer gameplay**: Players take on roles as Seekers or Hiders, using strategic sound-based gameplay to evade or capture opponents.
- **Proximity chat**: Real-time communication allows for strategic planning, but also risks giving away positions through sound.


### Technologies Used:
- **Unity Editor 2022.3.21f1** for game development
- **C#** for scripting and game mechanics
- **Blender** for 3D modeling
- **Photoshop** for texturing and artwork

### Repository Structure:
- `Assets/` - Contains game assets, including models, textures, and sounds.
- `Scripts/` - All game-related C# scripts for echolocation, player movement, and interactions.
- `Scenes/` - Unity scenes for levels, menus, and environments.
- `README.md` - Project overview and vision.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:  

git clone https://github.com/harryDeane/COMP3000.git

2. Open the project in **Unity 2022.3.21f1**.
3. Ensure VR hardware is connected and configured (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.).
4. Build and run the game in Unity for VR testing.
